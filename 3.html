What if we didn't have no pop
If the popsong writers just gave up
Popsong supplyment would stop
That would be something
And the popsong singer might just say
"I won't sing if I'm not paid
At least not if I won't get laid
Just give me something"
And the popsong label A&R
Just don't know how it got this far
"I had to sell my Jaguar
Just to get something"
